# FreeCodeCamp challange#1: a Tribute page
My first html/css page

### The story behind
This simple static page was developed as my first project to gain the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).
Those were the <b>user stories</b>: 

### User Stories:
* My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
* I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
* Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
* Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
* I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
* The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* The img element should be centered within its parent element.

### Comment:
For this project I chose an icon of Italian design: the Lettera22 Olivetti. 
Graphic choices were made following the style of the Lettera22: round corners, light colors and a title that imitates the keyboard of the typewriter. 
This last one thing was my very first aproach in creating shapes with CSS. 
It was not required to build a responsive page, but I tried to do my best to create a page that looks good on quite all the devices. 
Still this project can't really be considered responsive.
